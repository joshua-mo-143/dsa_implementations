## Data Structure Types

### Stack
A stack is a collection of items in which you can add and remove items, but only from the top (LIFO).

An example of this would be on a crowded train: if you're the last person in, you're also the first person out.


### Queue
A queue is a collection of items that uses FIFO - so it can only be added to from the back, and items can only be removed from the front.
